   * &lt;p>
   *  The method receives two handlers: onFulfilled for the resolution and onRejected for the rejection.
   *  As agreed, the onFulfilled receives the resolved value of the current promizen as its argument,
   *  and the onRejected receives the rejected reason of the current promizen as its argument.

   *    &lt;li>
   *      3. Otherwise, if the promizen is {@linkcode PENDING}, the onFulfilled and onRejected handlers will be stashed,
   *      and queued to the micro-task queue when the promizen is settled.
   *   &lt;/li>
   *  &lt;/ol>
   *  The queued onFulfilled or onRejected will be dequeued and executed, when the event-cycle reaches the micro-task queue,
   *  and the argument (value or reason of current promizen) passed to the handler is previous captured by closure.
   * &lt;/p>
   *
   * &lt;p>
   *  The then method immediately returns a new promizen, which is the key to promizen chaining.
   *  The new promizen will be resolved with the return value of the handlers or rejected with the error thrown from the handlers.
   *  The onFulfilled and onRejected handlers are optional. If they are not functions, they will be ignored, and the new Promizen
   *  will be resolved with the current promizen's value or rejected with the current promizen's reason.

   * @param {function} [onRejected] - The handler to execute when the promizen is {@linkcode REJECTED}.
